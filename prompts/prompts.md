        "Oberteile": ["T-Shirts", "Blusen", "Sweatshirts", "Pullover"],

}
```

```
Ich habe einen Online Shop für Mode. Was soll ich verkaufen?
```

```
Ich will das alles verkaufen. Erstelle mir eine Taxonomie mit 3 Levels.
Gib die Taxonomie als json zurück.
```

Start by generating a small number of products and refine their quality with additional prompts.

```
generiere 10 Produkte und nutze die Taxonomie für das Feld category.

{
    "id": "3266242",
    "title": "Longsleeve T-Shirt mit Logo Tegood - Comfort Fit",
    "sku" : "3266242",
    "price" : 25.99,
    "size" : "M",
    "color" : "blau",
    "category" : "Bekleidung/Damen/T-Shirts",
    "image" : "https://qsc.quasiris.de/cdn/qsc/demo/trendware/shop/data/img/3266242.png",
    "material" : ["Baumwolle", "Seide"],
    "style" : "casual"
  }
```

Check the results and optimize it.
```
the title must be like the example: Longsleeve T-Shirt mit Logo Tegood - Comfort Fit
```

Multiple iterations may be necessary to achieve the desired quality.
```
die Farbe soll immer mit im Titel stehen
```

Always specify that the output must be a downloadable file,
 otherwise, the response will be generated inline, leading to longer processing times.
```
make a download for 1000 products

## Find a name for the webshop
```
I have a online shop and i sell clothes ... find a funny name for my shop
```

The first shot was not that good.
```
some not funny names
```

The second attempt didn't quite meet expectations either.
Lets try it with an similar example:
```
MyFashionStore
```

The result was TrendWare, the new name of my web shop.
